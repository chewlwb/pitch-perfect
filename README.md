# pitch-perfect
This is a starter swift project to gain a basic understanding of UIKit and AVFoundation classes
THe idea is to write a simple program to record audio and play it back with any one of 4 effects:
  a.  Slow Playback (1/2 the recorded speed)
  b.  Fast Playback (2X the recorded speed)
  c.  Playback at higher pitch (to sound like a chipmunk)
  d.  Playback at lower pitch (to sound like Darth Vader)
